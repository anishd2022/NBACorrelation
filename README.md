# NBACorrelation

- This project aims to collect historical NBA data from the 2023-2024 season on player statistics, as well as historical odds for their over/under lines as put out by PrizePicks. By finding correlations between two or more players going either over or under their lines for a given game, I hope to find ways to take advantage of PrizePicks' fixed payout system. By placing correlated plays, big wins are more likely, and PrizePicks does NOT payout shift for NBA bets, so I hope to make profits by placing these parlays.
